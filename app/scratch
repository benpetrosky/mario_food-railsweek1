In particular, Mario is concerned about the information in his database being correct; your goal for today is to have the most comprehensive validations and callbacks to ensure information is properly saved and formatted in the database.


Landing Page

The landing page should include basic information about the company and should allow users to easily navigate to other areas of the site. This page should also include the three most recently added products and the product with the most reviews. See more information in the Scopes section below.

Products

The site needs to include a products section with a list of the tasty products that Mario sells. Each product should be clickable with a detail view.

Scopes

Your site should use scopes to display the following information on the site:

The product with the most reviews.
The three most recently added products.
All products made in the USA for buyers that want to buy local products.
Validations

Your site should include validations for the following:


Seeding

Your project should include seed data for 50 products and 250 reviews. Use Faker with a loop to seed the database.
Overall Styling

You'll be demoing this site to the CEO of Mario's Specialty Foods, so it should look presentable.
